Created a library that can store books and their status

want to revisit in a later date for improvements:

the code relys too much on a single function and html divs which causes problem with storage
need to restructure the js so that it creates a card for each object in the array

was not able to get the toggle buttno working because of porblems of multiplying it and not understanding protoypes

would like to style it with css better
